Ehypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab. Formerly a joint venture 
between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation,[4] the group was formed through the 
2020 survival competition show I-Land. The group cois a Snsists of seven 
members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-Ki. They 
debuted on November 30, 2020. The name Enhypen was introduced during the 
live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land. Etymologically, the group
 derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), representing "Connection, 
Discovery, &Growth".[5] Similar to how a hyphen connects different words 
to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect, discover
and grow together to form a new act"
